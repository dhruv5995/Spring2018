	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>I have collected physical data about myself using Xiaomi mi band 2 and my Android phone. More specifically I have collected the number of steps I have walked everyday over a time period to analyse and visualize the amount of physical exercise I do everyday.</a></p>

	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>My band is connected to my phone using Bluetooth and sometimes when it's discharged, it remains off for a day or two so during that time the data is not collected. To solve that I have chosen a set of time interval which is continuous and for which I have data available for all the days in that time interval.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>For checking the correctness of the dataset I performed two experiments. My first experiment was manually comparing the number of steps I walked and the number of steps it displays. I walked for 100 steps and then noted the increase in number of steps on my band. In this experiment I noticed that there was a difference of +-2% in the band data. As the number of steps shown for each trial of 100 steps was in the range of 98-102. However for this experiment I manually counted my steps till 100 which could be error-prone. So in my second experiment, I borrowed a fitness tracker from my friend. Wore both the bands and compared the increase in steps for multiple 15 minutes walk. Please note here that my friend's watch has more features and better sensors than mine. The difference in my friend's band and my band was about 3 steps and the average of absolute difference was about 6 steps. 		</p>
